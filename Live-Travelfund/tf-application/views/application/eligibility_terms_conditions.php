<h9>Callcredit Limited (&quot;we/us&quot;) is a UK consumer credit reference agency. A credit
reference agency collects and stores details about you and your personal credit
history. Lenders, including banks, building societies and other financial
service providers, share credit information about their customers with us. The
information we receive is used to create your credit report.</h9><br><br>

<h9>By submitting
your details, you are instructing us to provide your credit report to HD
Decisions Ltd (&quot;HD&quot;). HD has
been appointed as a processing agent for Travel Fund Limited (&quot;TF&quot;) &amp;
APS Financial Limited (&quot;AFL&quot;). HD will (on behalf of such credit intermediaries &amp; providers)
analyse key elements of your credit file, in order to determine your current
financial standing. The analysis of your credit file will be used by HD to
assess your eligibility for a Travelfund account. </h9><br><br>

<h9>Please note your credit file will not be provided to you directly. The information will be used
by HD, at your request, on your behalf, to assess your eligibility for a Travelfund
account. Any information received about
you during the eligibility check will be stored securely, whether or not you
proceed with a full Travelfund application, to help APS Financial Limited (in
partnership with Travel Fund Limited) analyse and develop their products and
services.</h9><br><br>

<h9>This process will not have any adverse impact upon your credit standing. If you choose to proceed to apply for a
Travelfund account then APS Financial Limited will proceed to carry out their
own identification and credit application checks.</h9><br><br>
