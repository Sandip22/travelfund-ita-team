<h9><b>1. Is this product suitable for what I want to use it for?</b></h9><br><br>

<h9>Our loan facility is a running account credit facility where we will provide you with a credit limit so that you canpurchase holiday travel products and services from your holiday provider. Once the credit agreement is made then you will have the opportunity to use the credit facility on any one of Travelfund's participating travel providers website's for up to 7 days. When you have made all of your purchases then we will inform you of the total amount you have to repay. This will be payable over a year will 12 equal monthly instalments. The interest rate we charge will be shown on the pre-contract credit information and in the credit agreement and this will help you to consider whether the cost, the monthly repayments, the term of the loan as well as other features are right for you.</h9><br><br>

<h9><b>2. How much will the credit cost me?</b></h9><br><br>

<h9>The total amount you will have to repay will depend on the amount you borrow. As an illustration, if you were to draw down your full Credit limit of &pound;1000 and repay this together with interest over one year in twelve equal instalments then the total amount to pay back will be &pound;1101.99 by 12 monthly instalments of &pound;91.83.
